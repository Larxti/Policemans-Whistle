Thank you for downloading my product!

The policeman's whistle was made for FiveM and is only currently available for the MP male ped only. I will release the MP female version when I get more time to finish it. This is a free release and is not permitted to be uploaded or released anywhere else. 
I made the whistle a standalone item so it can be used with badges you already have on your servers. The whistle can be found in the Bags/Parachues area but if you plan on using it with a badge you already have & it's also in the same area, just change the whistle name to a different area.

DEVS:
The dev model can be requested in my discord, Keep in mind that I will only allow certain people to gain access to the unlocked version as some devs are selling policeman whistle's for like $10+ and this was made to be a free alternative for the community.
